                        A resilient supply chain can not only help enterprises respond swiftly and effectively to economic, technological 
                        and market disruptions, but also gain a competitive advantage. The goal of a resilient supply chain is to minimize 
                        the negative impacts of these disruptions on revenues, costs, and customers. We employ programmatic approaches, 
                        leverage analytics capabilities and help enterprises to improve top-line growth, lower costs, reduce response 
                        times and increase productivity.

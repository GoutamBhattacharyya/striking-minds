                        It’s a tough gig running your business when employee management is taking up most of your time! We support small 
                        businesses that see themselves as gurus of their own industry, and enjoy the support of a HR service when they need it. 
                        If you’re running a small business you wouldn’t have the need for a full-time onsite HR function – this is where HR Management
